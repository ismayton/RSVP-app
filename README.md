# README

This app is a basic frontend representation of an RSVP application. Create new events in the console or add them via backend/app/db/seeds.rb. Add users via the form on each event's container, and remove them with their remove buttons.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.6.1
* Rails version 6.0.3

* Database creation
Run rails db:migrate to import the migrations.

* Database initialization
Run rails db:seed to import a few sample items included in the db/seeds file.

* How to run the test suite
There is no test suite for this application. Start a server in the backend folder (rails s) and open the frontend/index.html to see the project in action.
